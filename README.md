I’ve always struggled to find my files — especially assignments. It would often take me a long time just to search for the right file. So I decided to do something about it and built a simple File Organizer app.

This is a small Python application built with Tkinter that helps organize files automatically. The app lets you select a source folder and a destination folder using a simple GUI, and then it sorts files into categories like Images, Videos, Documents, and Zips. No more messy folders.

💡 What This App Does
Lets you choose source and destination folders using buttons
Automatically sorts files based on their type
Creates folders if they don’t already exist
Shows messages when the process is complete or if something goes wrong

🗂 File Categories
Images: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif
Videos: .mp4, .mov, .avi
Documents: .doc, .docx, .txt, .pdf
Zips: .zip, .rar

🛠 What I Learned
This project helped me:
Work with files and folders using Python’s os and shutil modules
Build a simple GUI using Tkinter
Handle user input and show messages using dialog boxes

▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/safalpokharel/File-Organizer.git
3. Go into the project folder
    cd File-Organizer
